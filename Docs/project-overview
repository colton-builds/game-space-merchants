# Space Economy Simulation Game

## Overview
A real-time space economy simulation game where players manage trade between planets with dynamic economies. The game features a complex economic system with production chains, commodity trading, and random events that impact planetary economies. This MVP will be implemented as a single-page web application running locally in a web browser. Trade happens when the player purchases commodities at one planet, flies to another planet, and sells them.

## Core Features

### Planetary System
- Eight planets with unique characteristics and economies
- Orbital mechanics and gravitational forces
- Dynamic planet positions and velocities
- Moon systems for select planets

### Economic System
- Complex production chains with input/output requirements
- Dynamic commodity markets with supply/demand mechanics
- Price fluctuations based on market conditions
- Storage capacity management
- Production and consumption rate modifiers

### Event System
- Random events affecting planetary economies
- Multiple event categories:
  - Environmental
  - Economic
  - Social/Political
  - Technological
- Configurable event frequency and impact
- Event log tracking system

### User Interface
- Pause menu with game controls
- Settings panel for event configuration
- Real-time market data display
- Event log viewer
- Planet information display

### Technical Implementation
- Object-oriented design with Planet and Moon classes
- Real-time simulation with time scaling
- Event-driven architecture
- UI system with interactive buttons and panels
- Dynamic market price calculations
- Production chain management
- Error handling following industry best practices
- Local browser-based execution

## Game Mechanics

### Economy
- Planets have unique production capabilities
- Commodities have base prices and dynamic market prices
- Production requires input commodities
- Storage capacity limits affect production
- Distance affects energy unit prices

### Events
- Events can modify:
  - Production rates
  - Consumption rates
  - Supply quantities
  - Demand quantities
- Event frequency is configurable
- Multiple simultaneous events possible
- Events can target specific commodities or all commodities

### Trading
- Buy/sell prices based on supply ratios
- Price factors influenced by:
  - Supply/demand balance
  - Distance (for energy units)
  - Market conditions
- Minimum price margins maintained

## Technical Details

### Key Classes
- `Planet`: Manages planet state, economy, and events
- `Moon`: Handles moon orbit and rendering
- UI Components: Various panels and buttons for interaction

### Core Systems
- Planet and star gravity
- Spaceship size, mass, momentum, thrust force
- Spaceship cargo capacity, upgrades
- Market simulation, comodity pricing (sell, buy) variability and change over time
- Event generation and management
- Production chain processing - some comodity markets require other commodities to rise
- Price calculation
- UI rendering and interaction

### Configuration Options
- Event Settings
  - Event frequency multipliers
  - Maximum active events
  - Type-specific event frequency
- Time scaling
- Key Bindings
- UI layout and appearance

### Development Scope
- Single-player only
- Local browser-based execution
- No save/load functionality in MVP
- No backend integration in MVP
- Future considerations:
  - User account management
  - Backend integration
  - Save/load functionality
  - Multiplayer capabilities
